# Summary

Basically, a repository with hooks pre-commit using:

- `Black`: A Python code formatter
- `Flake8`: A code checker for your Python code
- `isort`: A Python library for sorting imports

## Notes

The settings made here are not 100% in compliance with PEP8. I personally think that 79 characters for a line length are not enough  and rather use 100 instead.
